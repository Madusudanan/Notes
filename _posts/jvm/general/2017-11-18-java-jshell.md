JShell
------

Finally the REPL for Java is here. Other languages were boasting it, but we have got it in Java now. The initial idea of a REPL came from the Lisp
community.

A comprehensive coverage of the JShell REPL.

[![JShell: An Interactive Shell for the Java Platform by Robert Field](https://img.youtube.com/vi/jziVaht480w/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziVaht480w){:target="_blank"}

Some of the other languages that have REPL.

- Scala
- Kotlin
- LISP
- Python
- Haskell

The main aim is to improve productivity and is available as part of JDK 9.

Some might argue that JShell is useless since Java itself is verbose, but Java is improving and with interesting projects such as Project Amber
and Project Valhalla coming in, the possibilities have jumped up several places.
