Part 1
------

Akka is a toolkit for building reactive systems on the JVM. It has a ton of individual modules, but we are going to start with Akka Actor API. It is a module to write concurrency abstraction and distributed systems on the JVM.

Akka is a toolkit as opposed to being a framework. A framework is a opinionated way of doing things but a toolkit is much more low level. 

Let's define our first hello world actor.

{% highlight java %}

import akka.actor.AbstractActor;
import akka.event.Logging;
import akka.event.LoggingAdapter;

public class HelloWorldActor extends AbstractLoggingActor {

        @Override
        public AbstractActor.Receive createReceive() {
            return receiveBuilder()
                    .match(String.class, s -> {
                        log().info("Received String message: {}", s);
                    })
                    .matchAny(o -> log().info("received unknown message"))
                    .build();
        }
}

{% endhighlight %}

And below is the main method to run the app i.e send message to the Actor.

{% highlight java %}

import akka.actor.ActorRef;
import akka.actor.ActorSystem;
import akka.actor.Props;


public class Runner {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create("HelloWorld");

        ActorRef actor = system.actorOf(Props.create(HelloWorldActor.class),"HelloWorldActor");

        actor.tell("Hi there", ActorRef.noSender());

        system.terminate();

    }

}

{% endhighlight %}

Let's talk about the logic required to run an actor and then understand actor internals.

`ActorSystem` is like the container for running the actors. As per the docs, there should be only one actor system
per application. We will explore more about this later.

Next we create an `ActorRef` which holds a reference to an actor. We will do actions on the actor using this reference.

Next we use the `tell` method to send a message to an actor. Since Akka actors are by default untyped, we can send any message and it upto the receiving actor to parse it correctly. In reality, a good practice would be to have good classes defined for all messages we send to an Actor. Notice that in the second parameter we use `ActorRef.noSender()`. We would use this in-built construct if we are communicating to actors from outside of an Actor, in our case the main method. Later, we can look at an example where we will communicate between two actors.

Let's move on to the actual Actor itself. Our class extends the `AbstractLoggingActor` which is a mix of `AbstractActor` with a in built `Logger` implementation. We can make use of this if we want to log stuff or else if we want to roll out our own custom implementation then we can use only `AbstractActor`. Everything else is the same. Inside of our actor we override a method called `createReceive` which returns a variable of the type `Receive`. This is a Scala construct and in the Akka Java API we use something called the `receiveBuilder()` to build the object using the famous builder pattern. The `match` method is where the core logic lies. We match on the incoming message type which is `String` in our case. If we send a message which is not of the `String` class type then we log a different message using `matchAny` method. Finally, we call the `build()` method to build the final object. 

That's it for this part. In the next part, we will explore a ping-pong example in Akka with two Actors.
