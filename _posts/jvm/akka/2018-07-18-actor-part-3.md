Part-3
------

In the last part we saw how Actors can be used for a ping-pong scenario. But these required specific classes to be created. In this part we will explore how to pass arbitrary messages to an Actor and how the Actor can 
act/respond to it.

`match` and `matchAny`

We already saw this in previous parts. `match` can be used for a specific class and `matchAny` is for all of the remaining cases like the default case of the switch construct.

{% highlight java %}

@Override
        public Receive createReceive() {
            return receiveBuilder()
                    .match(String.class, s -> {
                        log().info("Received String message: {}", s);
                    })
                    .matchAny(o -> log().info("received unknown message"))
                    .build();
        }
 
{% endhighlight %}

`matchEquals`

`matchEquals` matches object equals. It directly calls the `Object.equals` method. A simple example below.

{% highlight java %}

@Override
        public Receive createReceive() {
            return receiveBuilder()
                    .matchEquals("dev", s -> {
                        log().info("Dev environment");
                    })
                    .matchEquals("qa", s -> {
                        log().info("QA environment");
                    })
                    .matchEquals("prod", s ->{
                        log().info("Production environment");
                    })
                    .matchAny(o -> log().info("received unknown message"))
                    .build();
        }

{% endhighlight %}

`matchUnchecked` is used in situations where type erasure sets in i.e situation as in generics etc.,

Will explore in future as required.
