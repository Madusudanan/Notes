Part-2
------

In Part 1 we saw basics of Actors and how to create one. In this part, let's understand a more complex example.

We are going to create a ping-pong app in which the Ping will send a message to Pong and it will relay back the message again to Ping.

But first, let's design the message class i.e the message which is going to be sent between the two actors.

{% highlight java %}

public class Message {

    public int counter = 0;

}

{% endhighlight %}

The `Message` class is pretty self descriptive. It just contains one variable called `counter`.

Next, let's design the `Ping` class.

{% highlight java %}

import akka.actor.AbstractLoggingActor;
import akka.actor.ActorRef;

public class Ping extends AbstractLoggingActor {

    static ActorRef actorRef;

    public static void setActorRef(ActorRef actorRef){
        Ping.actorRef = actorRef;
    }

    @Override
    public Receive createReceive() {
        return receiveBuilder().match(
            Message.class, data -> {
                System.out.println(data.counter++);
                actorRef.tell(data,self());
            }).build();
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
 
We maintain a reference to the actor we want to message at the class variable level using the variable `actorRef` which is being set via the method `setActorRef`. It is the responsiblity of the app developer to initialize this variable before sending messages to the Actor. Logic of the builder is pretty self-explanatory i.e it just prints the number and then increments the variable.

The `Pong` actor is also similar,

{% highlight java %}

import akka.actor.AbstractLoggingActor;
import akka.actor.ActorRef;

public class Pong extends AbstractLoggingActor {

    static ActorRef actorRef;

    public static void setActorRef(ActorRef actorRef){
        Pong.actorRef = actorRef;
    }

    @Override
    public Receive createReceive() {
        return receiveBuilder().match(
                Message.class, data -> {
                    System.out.println(data.counter++);
                    actorRef.tell(data,self());
                }).build();
    }
}

 
{% endhighlight %}


Next, we initialize the ping pong by sending the message to the `Ping` class first.

{% highlight java %}

import akka.actor.ActorRef;
import akka.actor.ActorSystem;
import akka.actor.Props;

public class Runner {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create("PingPong");

        ActorRef pingActor = system.actorOf(Props.create(Ping.class),"PingActor");

        ActorRef pongActor = system.actorOf(Props.create(Pong.class),"PongActor");

        Ping.setActorRef(pongActor);

        Pong.setActorRef(pingActor);

        Message msg = new Message();

        pingActor.tell(msg,ActorRef.noSender());


    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

This will keep on running infinitely.

We saw several things in this example. I.e how to call an actor from another actor and sending a usef defined object instead of a standard type.

A very important thing to note is that the Actors may or may not run in separate threads depending upon the dispatcher configuration and also the OS at run time. Notice that  we accessed and mutated the counter variable directly from different Actors. This is actually an anti-pattern, i.e we should use getters and setters and also use referential transparency, but this demonstrates that this can be used without any locks just by using a different programming paradigm using Actors. Message passing is a pretty powerful of doing stuff without having the need to lock or synchronize variables/methods.
