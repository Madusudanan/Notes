JSP is Dead
-----------

In the Java land, nothing ever dies. It just fades into oblivion because of stupid managers making the decision to not solve technical debt.

In the olden days just after HTML, javascript was born. JS is now extremely popular today because of many technological advancements. Also mainly because that mobile devices, personal computers became powerful and can now run complex apps. Now the business logic is pushed to the client side for execution with the backend being API driven. Server side generated JS code being rendered in the client side is pretty much dead. 

Another reason why API driven approach is becoming more popular because of microservices a.k.a the Service Oriented Architecture 2.0. Microservices are pretty much a different topic to be dealt with.

Since mobile apps are becoming famous, utilizing the same backend APIs for mobile apps is also a very good approach in terms of code re-use
